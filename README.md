# Simulate the infection in a computer network
Project of Prob and Stat class

The purpose of this project was to simulate the spread of a virus in a network of computers using the Monte Carlo method. The project was based on exercise #5.10 from the textbook, and the simulation involved the incorporation of randomness to accurately represent the phenomenon being studied.

The simulation was designed to work with provided values initially, ensuring proper functioning. In addition, the project included the option for the user to input values such as the number of computers in the network, the probability of spreading the infection, and the number of computers repaired daily, making it a more advanced and flexible tool.

To achieve accurate results, multiple runs of the simulation were conducted in a loop with a large number of iterations (N=10000). This approach allowed for a thorough analysis of the spread of the virus in the computer network under various conditions.

The outcome of the project was a functional and user-friendly Monte Carlo simulation, capable of providing valuable insights into the spread of viruses in computer networks. The results of the simulation can be used to inform future efforts in preventing and controlling the spread of viruses in similar networks

Multiple runs of the simulation (a large number, such as N=10000) were conducted in a loop to ensure accurate results.
