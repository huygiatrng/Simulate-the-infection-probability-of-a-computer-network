# Simulate the infection in a computer network

## Overview

This project aims to simulate the spread of a virus in a network of computers using the Monte Carlo method. Originating from a problem described in exercise #5.10 of a textbook, the simulation incorporates randomness to accurately represent the infection phenomenon.

Through various user-configurable inputs, this simulation offers the ability to understand the behavior of virus spread in different conditions, making it a flexible and versatile tool.

## Features
Provides default values for quick simulations.
User input is facilitated for the number of computers, infection probability, computers repaired daily, and iterations.
Advanced Monte Carlo simulations for comprehensive results.
Visual representation through histograms to showcase the spread dynamics.
## Requirements
Python
Matplotlib for visual representation: pip install matplotlib
Any dependencies mentioned in distributions (Note: As distributions is not provided, ensure you have relevant imports and dependencies.)


## Usage

### Default Run

For a quick run with default parameters:
    
    ```bash
    pyhon main.py
